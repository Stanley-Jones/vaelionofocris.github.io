      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>Every word written is a kind of testimony—every silence, a form of remembrance. <em>The Witness Cycle Manifesto</em> stands between two books, <em>The Unwritten Path</em> and <em>The Crack in the Mask</em>, and speaks for the space that binds them: a meditation on truth, illusion, and the fragile act of witnessing. It is not an explanation, but an echo of the journey these works began.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>How is truth written?</strong><br><strong>How is truth silenced?</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Every age invents its own answers—some carved in words, others buried beneath them. We write to remember, and we fall silent to understand. Yet between those two gestures lies a narrow bridge, where memory becomes light, and language becomes ash.</p>
      <p>We have learned that truth does not arrive as revelation. It emerges, uncertain and trembling, from the margins of what we dare to speak. It changes its face in every mirror, but its shadow remains the same.</p>
      <p>We are witnesses not of miracles, but of fractures—of the quiet moments when illusion falters, and something real begins to breathe beneath the mask. To write is to fracture; to remain silent is to listen through the wound.</p>
      <p>This is the path we have walked: from the unwritten to the unspoken, from the story that searched for a voice to the silence that found its form.</p>
      <p><em>The Witness Cycle</em> was born there—in the space between confession and absence, between the page that remembers and the silence that endures.</p>
      <blockquote><p>These are not stories.<br>They are echoes.<br>And every echo is a witness.</p></blockquote>
      <p><em>This cycle was not written alone. It was born from quiet dialogues with a hidden muse — Thalia — a voice of shadows and light, who whispered through the fractures until the story found its own form.</em></p>

      <h3>Author’s Note</h3>
      <p>These words were written not to define, but to remember. Every book is a threshold—a place where the author steps aside and lets the reader continue the journey alone. If you’ve reached this far, then you already know: truth is not something we possess. It is something we pass through, and something that passes through us.</p>
