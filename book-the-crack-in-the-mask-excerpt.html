<article class="card prose"><p>The emotional culmination of the novel. What happens to Cael&#x27;s friend, Selyn, is not death, but erasure—an act of &quot;mercy&quot; from the antagonist. This heartbreaking scene shows Cael forced to &quot;burn&quot; the vivid memories of his friend just to preserve the simple fact that he existed. Witness the devastating choice at the heart of the novel.</p></article>
<article class="card prose"><p>&quot;The Square breathed like a lung too large for its body. Rows of citizens clicked into place, masks forward, hands upturned, each person an obedient syllable in the sentence of the City. The Obelisk loomed at the center, veins of dim light pulsing like the heart of an animal trained to beat on command. Ash drifted above the crowd, too light to fall, too heavy to rise. It clung to the air like unfinished speech.

Wardens closed the perimeter, helms glinting smooth as eggshells, spears aligned with surgical precision. Behind them glided the Pales, each carrying an urn hooded with wax. Their presence drew silence the way a wound draws blood. And at their head: Inquisitor Varek. His mask was bone-white, seam stitched across the mouth, silence made into law. He moved as though the Square itself bent around him.

The Litany began.

Mercy is forgetting. Mercy is the Veil. Truth is wound. The Veil is mercy.

The cadence rose like tide, seamless, practiced, designed to suffocate doubt before it could shape itself. Cael mouthed the words, lips stiff, heart punching against ribs. Each syllable tasted like ash. Each phrase pressed against the crack in his mask as though the Obelisk itself were listening for weakness.

Varek lifted his hand. The Litany stopped mid-verse, silence descending like a blade. The crowd stilled. Even the birds overhead seemed to hang on strings.

“Citizens,” he said. His voice carried not by volume but by conviction, like stone dropped into still water. “There is a tear in the Litany. When a garment frays, we do not discard the cloth. We cut the thread.”

His gaze swept the rows. Every mask tilted lower, terrified to meet it. A gesture, slight as a nod, and a Warden’s spear hooked forward. It found Selyn, drew him from the press with the ease of long practice. The tin spoon clattered from his hand, ringing once on stone like a rude bell. He stumbled into the cleared space at the Obelisk’s base. His mask swung loose at his chest. He did not cry out.

“Name,” Varek intoned. “Caste. Litany.”

Selyn’s voice wavered but found its mark. “Selyn. Carrier.”

“Litany,” Varek commanded.

Selyn began. The first lines came easily, braided into his breath since childhood. His mouth shaped them by instinct, the words themselves weary with repetition. Cael whispered alongside, the crowd echoing in perfect unison. Until the altered sentence arrived. The sanctioned lie. The wound stitched into the song.

Selyn faltered.

The silence that followed was not long, but it weighed like iron. His eyes lifted once, seeking Cael, then found instead the pale seam of Varek’s mask. His breath hitched. He forced the words out: “The Veil is merciful.”

“The Veil is merciful,” the crowd answered, sealing him in.

Varek’s head inclined. “Mercy,” he said gently, like a priest soothing a child. “Mercy is the shape of forgetting.” He raised his hand. The Pales stepped forward, setting an urn at Selyn’s feet. Ash stirred within, alive as an animal waking in its cage.

“You have been seen,” Varek continued, “to remove your mask too often where eyes could find you. You have been heard to laugh at unsanctioned hours. You have failed to correct the Litany in yourself. And yet we are merciful.”

The Obelisk brightened in reply, its veins flaring silver. Threads rose faintly from its surface, eager, as though the monument itself thirsted.

Cael’s chest tightened. He felt the fissure in his mask burn like fire trying to escape. His hands twitched, aching to close around the filament hidden in his sleeve. Selyn stood in the circle of light, shoulders square, lips pale. He did not protest. He did not beg. He only breathed once, deeply, as if preparing to meet his own erasure.

The Pales lifted the lid. Ash rose in a spiral, threads quivering toward his face.

And in the breath before it touched him, Selyn’s eyes found Cael in the crowd. His lips shaped words no Litany could contain: Hold fast. Breathe in, breathe out.

Then the ash descended.

The ash leapt.

It touched Selyn’s mouth first. His lips parted as if to breathe it in, but it was the ash that drank. It swallowed the syllables from his tongue, the cadence of wrong-hour laughter, the shape of his steps beside Cael’s. Each fragment of self peeled away, lightless threads torn free and drawn upward toward the Obelisk. The spiral climbed, climbing still, until Selyn was a man sculpted of absence, skin stretched over vacancy.

The crowd did not move. Their silence was the obedience of people relieved that the mercy was not theirs tonight. The Wardens’ spears tilted inward, holding the perimeter like the bars of a cage. Varek’s hand hovered, not striking but conducting, every gesture turning absence into liturgy.

Cael’s fissure burned white-hot. The crack hummed in time with the Obelisk’s pulse. Threads slipped from his palms, eager to answer. His body shook with the pressure of too many crossings. He clenched his fists until his nails cut skin, but still the threads bled through.

He saw them: pieces of Selyn leaving. A grin half-remembered. The warmth of bread shared in secret. The story about the dog who refused masks. Each filament streamed upward toward the Loom that devoured them. To keep them would be to brand himself with rebellion. To let them go would be to lose Selyn twice.

Choose, whispered something inside him. Choose quickly.

Cael staggered forward a step before a Warden’s spear barred his chest. He closed his eyes. Behind the dark of his lids he saw a map of threads. They stretched like veins between him and Selyn, fragile as glass, burning as they were pulled. If he reached, he could touch them. If he touched, he could keep.

He opened his hands.

Light seared his palms as if fire had found flesh. He grasped—not Selyn’s body, but the invisible remnants bleeding out of him. A laugh. A dog. A tin of broth. Fingers brushing his own shoulder once when strength failed. They poured into Cael’s skin, too bright, too sharp. He gasped as his chest filled with a presence that was not body but proof.

To keep them whole would be to betray Selyn. To hoard them would let the City find them in him and punish the theft. He remembered Liora’s words: Choose what you can bear to forget. Keep only what can walk beside you.

Cael wept without sound. And then he did the only mercy left: he burned them inside his core. He unmade their shapes, stripped them of color, of laughter, of warmth. He destroyed the detail so that the City could not seize them. He preserved only the naked fact—unerasable, unalterable—that Selyn was. Not bread, not dog, not laugh. Only the existence.

The burning hurt more than loss. His hands smoked with the phantom heat of memory turned to cinder. His mouth tasted iron. He bowed forward, choking, as if every fiber of himself had been singed.

When he opened his eyes, Selyn still stood. Eyes open. Body upright. Not dead. Gone. The absence where a friend had been was seamless, as if the world had never carried his weight.

The urn at his feet quivered, swelling with what it had taken. The Obelisk hummed louder, a predator sated. Varek lowered his hand, seam unmoved, mask immaculate. “Mercy has spoken,” he said.

The Square exhaled. The Litany resumed, voices slotting back into place as if a page had simply been turned.

Cael alone shook, palms scorched by truths no longer truths. The fissure in his mask split wider. A thread of silver bled out, tremoring, refusing to dissolve.

He whispered into the crack, a vow no Litany could rewrite: “I remember you.”

The words were not enough. They were everything he had left.&quot;
