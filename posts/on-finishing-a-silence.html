<section class="blog"><h1>On Finishing a Silence</h1><article class="post"><div class="post-body">(by Vaelion of Ocris)<br/><br/>There is no real ending to a silence — only the moment when it stops needing you to hold it.<br/><br/>Every book I’ve written began with noise.<br/>Thoughts arguing, memories demanding shape.<br/>But somewhere along the way, the words learned their own restraint.<br/>They began to fall quiet — not from exhaustion, but from understanding.<br/><br/>Silence, I’ve come to believe, is not the absence of sound.<br/>It is language that no longer requires translation.<br/>It speaks in weight, in breath, in the way a room remembers what was once said within it.<br/><br/>The Witness Cycle was never about telling stories.<br/>It was about learning when to stop.<br/>When to let truth exist without decoration,<br/>and when to trust that the reader will listen even after the page has gone still.<br/><br/>Finishing a silence is like releasing a bird you’ve nursed from a storm —<br/>you don’t watch to see where it lands.<br/>You only hope it remembers the sky.<br/><br/>— Vaelion of Ocris</div></article></section>
