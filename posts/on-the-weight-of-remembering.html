<section class="blog"><h1>On the Weight of Remembering</h1><article class="post"><div class="post-body">(by Vaelion of Ocris)<br/><br/>There are memories that do not ask to be kept.<br/>They linger like smoke — not pleading for air, only refusing to disappear.<br/><br/>Writing The Witness Cycle taught me that remembering is not nostalgia.<br/>It is resistance.<br/>Each act of memory is a small defiance against the machinery of forgetting.<br/><br/>But there is a cost.<br/>To remember is to carry what others have set down.<br/>It is to walk through silence knowing that not all echoes want to be heard.<br/><br/>In The Unwritten Path, memory begins as a seed — fragile, uncertain, still believing in renewal.<br/>By The Crack in the Mask, it has become a wound that refuses to heal cleanly.<br/>Between them lies the question I still cannot answer:<br/>how much truth can the body bear before it starts calling it burden?<br/><br/>Perhaps witnessing and remembering are the same discipline:<br/>to stay beside what hurts without demanding that it end.<br/>To let silence have its weight — and still lift it.<br/><br/>Because forgetting is mercy for those who wish to sleep.<br/>But remembering — remembering is the work of those who stay awake.<br/><br/>— Vaelion of Ocris</div></article></section>
