<article class="card prose"><p>A chilling scene that moves the conflict from the café to the corporate office. Here, euphemism is a weapon, and language is used as &quot;moral anesthesia&quot; to justify cruelty (&quot;human assets&quot;). It features a stunning confrontation where Thalia defines truth not as a virtue, but as &quot;hygiene.&quot; Explore the excerpt where bureaucracy becomes a threat.</p></article>
<article class="card prose"><p>&quot;The office smelled like order—sterile air, filtered light, the faint perfume of bureaucracy. Rows of desks hummed beneath fluorescent constancy; monitors blinked like obedient eyes. The talking ones had evolved here too—quieter, better dressed, fluent in efficiency.

“Just fix the numbers,” someone said. “No one checks the old records anyway.” “Exactly,” another replied. “If the data supports the outcome, that’s accuracy enough.”

Vaelion sat at his terminal, the cursor blinking like a heartbeat. The spreadsheet stared back at him—neat, deceitful. A single column of numbers didn’t add up, and everyone pretended not to notice.

He had seen mistakes before, but this one was deliberate—a small lie dressed as optimization. No villainy, no conspiracy—just arithmetic convenience. The file was due at noon; truth had no deadline.

He stared at the entry again. The sum was wrong, but the story it told was right—the company looked cleaner, the results smoother, the effort justified. Only accuracy had died quietly in the margins.

“Fix it,” said the supervisor, walking past. “Don’t overthink.”

The words hit like an echo from the café—the same rhythm of assumed wisdom, only sterilized. He almost smiled; civilization had perfected the art of moral anesthesia.

The Annoying One whispered from somewhere behind his temples: “You could change it, you know. One correction, and you’d be pure again.” “Or,” it added, “you could let it pass and finally belong.”

He hesitated. Belonging—the last illusion of the ethical mind. He typed a few keys, then stopped. His reflection on the monitor was faint but visible; it looked more precise than he felt.

A thought—not his—aligned itself behind the noise: “Truth is not virtue. It’s hygiene.”

He froze. The voice had no emotion, only balance. It wasn’t The Annoying One—this one didn’t accuse; it calibrated. He felt the shift—the entrance of Thalia, not as apparition this time, but as geometry of conscience.

“They don’t want you to lie,” she said. “They want you not to notice.”

“Same outcome,” he thought.

“Different guilt,” she replied.

The talking ones continued their polite productivity. He looked around—no villains, just hands moving, keyboards clicking, good people doing tidy harm.

The cursor blinked again. He changed one digit—the correct one. A small defiance, invisible to anyone but the file.

He hit save. A soundless act of rebellion.

For a moment, nothing changed. Then the system recalculated, numbers adjusting, columns shifting—the false narrative collapsing in perfect silence.

He expected relief. Instead, he felt lighter—as if something had been subtracted from his existence, not added.

“Happy now?” the Annoying One asked.

“No,” he said. “But clean.”

Thalia’s voice lingered like symmetry: “Clarity isolates faster than cruelty.”

He leaned back. The office hummed around him, serene, oblivious. Nobody noticed. Nobody ever did.

He realized this was what witnessing meant: not to be seen, but to see—completely, and endure the cost.

The screen flickered once—a brief pulse, like acknowledgment. Then the file closed itself. No alert, no applause. Just silence—immaculate, almost kind.

The office had the sterile brightness of a wound that refused to close. Everything gleamed with administrative virtue—the scent of citrus cleaner, the hum of monitored efficiency. On every desk sat a small plant, each leaf glossy as compliance.

At 9:00 sharp, the email arrived. Its subject line read with corporate warmth: Strategic Realignment.

Vaelion opened it, already knowing the tone before the words appeared. He read slowly, as though decoding scripture:

In order to ensure sustainable growth and optimize our operational potential, the company will be restructuring certain human assets.

Human assets. He stared at the phrase until the letters blurred, softening into a kind of mercy. Beneath it came a cascade of euphemisms—&quot;transitioning,&quot; &quot;streamlining,&quot; &quot;enhancing efficiency.&quot; Nowhere did it say firing. Language had done its duty: violence, disinfected.

Around him, screens flickered like anxious halos. No one spoke. They didn’t need to. Silence had become policy.

The Annoying One cleared its throat from somewhere behind the monitor. &quot;See? Even cruelty learned to say thank you.&quot;

Vaelion smiled thinly. The comment was fair. He scrolled to the bottom of the email, where the company’s motto gleamed in italics: Together, We Grow.

He whispered, &quot;Some plants feed on light. Others on blood.&quot;

A soft ping—another message. This one from The Moderator, now operating under a different title: Human Resources Partner. &gt; We appreciate your continued positivity during this period of organizational transformation.

He could almost hear the smile behind the words—that smooth, unassailable civility that strangled all protest before it formed. He imagined The Moderator typing, deleting, rephrasing until the sentence became perfectly inoffensive—a masterpiece of moral anesthesia.

He opened his notebook beneath the desk and wrote: Truth leaves fingerprints. Purity leaves none.【33†source】

He hesitated, then added: We polish the knife until it reflects our faces.

For a moment, he thought of sending it—a single line in reply to the company’s email—but the idea felt theatrical. He closed the notebook. The act of not speaking was sometimes the last form of sincerity.

Thalia’s presence stirred faintly—not as words, but as pressure in the air. Thalia: You want the truth to make noise. It never does. Vaelion: Then how does it survive? Thalia: By refusing applause.

He leaned back. The office hummed around him, serene, efficient, holy in its order. Somewhere, a printer exhaled. A colleague laughed quietly at something on a screen—the sound of life adjusting to moral vacancy.

He closed his eyes. The fluorescent light passed through his lids, painting him transparent. For the first time that day, he felt perfectly visible—and completely unseen.&quot;
