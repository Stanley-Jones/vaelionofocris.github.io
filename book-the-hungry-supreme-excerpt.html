<section class="hero"><div class="subtitle">Excerpt</div><h1>The Hungry Supreme</h1></section>
<article class="card prose"><p>A perfect, cyclical conclusion to the meditation. The arrival of a Supreme who returns not to judge, but because he is hungry, is a brilliant twist. &quot;He had invented hunger before he invented love; only one of them learned to pray.&quot; A deeply provocative and satisfying scene. Explore the excerpt where the Supreme finally reveals its nature.</p></article>
<article class="card prose"><p>&quot;He arrived quietly, the way smoke returns after the fire forgets it began. No trumpets, no angels — only the faint clink of cooled cutlery, and the soft hum of refrigeration preserving faith.

The room smelled of cleanliness and crime. The table still bore the shape of devotion: an empty dish, a knife asleep beside its purpose, a few crumbs clinging to holiness.

Supreme looked at the scene as an archaeologist might examine his own handwriting. Nothing surprised him anymore. He touched the knife; it did not burn. He touched the plate; it remembered warmth. He touched the air and found it seasoned with apology.

“Still eating?” he asked, though no one remained. The echo answered yes.

He sat. The chair welcomed him out of habit. He poured the last of the wine — fermented repentance, still sweet. It tasted of centuries behaving themselves.

“They called it sacrifice,” he murmured, “but it was always catering.” He smiled without conviction. He had invented hunger before he invented love; only one of them learned to pray.

On the wall hung a painting of a lamb — serene, unreal, spotless. He raised his glass to it. “Perfection,” he said, “is what kills the living.” The painting did not disagree.

Outside, night gathered the remains of daylight like a waiter clearing plates. Inside, the god exhaled, and the candle obeyed.

He whispered, not to the world but to the silence behind it: “Creation was never moral. It was merely efficient.”

Then he stood, leaving no shadow — only a small warmth where the wine had been. The knife gleamed, patient as law.

From somewhere far below, a lamb bleated — not in pain, but in memory. The sound rose through the ceiling, gentle as forgiveness. Supreme listened, tired and grateful. It was good to be needed again.&quot;
