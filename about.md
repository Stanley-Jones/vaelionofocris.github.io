# About · Vaelion of Ocris

**The Witness Cycle** is a dialogue between language and silence — two books sharing one spine:

- *The Unwritten Path* — “How is truth written?”
- *The Crack in the Mask* — “How is truth silenced?”

I write to **witness**, not to explain. Some things do not ask for clarity — they ask for presence.

## Manifesto (short)

- Silence is not absence; it’s **attention**.  
- Memory is **resistance** against the machinery of forgetting.  
- Truth is a **wound**; we don’t decorate it — we **remain** beside it.  
- Stories are bridges. Readers are not audience; they are **witnesses**.
